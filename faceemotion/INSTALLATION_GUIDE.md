✅ Skin lesion fills 50%+ of frame

❌ AVOID:
❌ Dark, shadowy lighting
❌ Blurry or out-of-focus images
❌ Too far away (lesion barely visible)
❌ Multiple lesions in one photo
❌ Extreme angles or distortion
```

### **Interpreting Results:**

#### **High Confidence (80-100%):**
```
🎯 STRONG INDICATION
Result: 95% Monkeypox Likelihood
Action: Immediate medical consultation

Action: Medical consultation recommended
Timeline: Schedule appointment within 2-3 days
```

#### **Low Confidence (0-59%):**
```
ℹ️ LOW LIKELIHOOD
Result: 30% Monkeypox Likelihood
Action: Monitor symptoms, consult if concerned
